Invoke the pm-orchestrator subagent to run a full work session.

The PM will:
1. Read roadmap.md for current priorities
2. Read PLAN.md for any work in progress
3. Pick the next task (or continue current one)
4. Execute using strict TDD methodology
5. Commit at every logical step
6. Verify with qa-reviewer before marking complete
7. Update roadmap.md with progress

Continue working until the current task is fully complete or you need my input. Do not stop early.
